# Public-use SIPP data

Raw data is downloaded from NBER's website. See `Data/download_NBER_all.sh`. 

The files I use for descriptive statistics are all of the do-files in `Analysis/`. These files make use of processed SIPP files as created in Ashworth & Ransom (2019, Economics of Education Review). See replication repository [here](https://github.com/tyleransom/EER_CWP).

The aforementioned do-files output several graphics in .eps format. These are included in the paper and its online appendix.
